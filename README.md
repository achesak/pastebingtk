# About PastebinGTK

PastebinGTK is a desktop client for the [pastebin.com](http://pastebin.com/) text sharing service.

Among other features, it is able to create,
read, and delete pastes, as well as list recent pastes and pastes created by a user.

# Using PastebinGTK

PastebinGTK requires the Python interpreter to run. Development is done using 2.7.x, but it should work with 3.x as well. GTK+ 3 and its
Python bindings are also required.

To run PastebinGTK, open a terminal in the directory containing the files and type `python pastebingtk.py`. On some systems double-clicking on the 
`pastebingtk.py` file will also work.

PastebinGTK currently only runs on Linux and Windows. Note that while the application should work on Windows, it is not extensively tested on that
platform.
