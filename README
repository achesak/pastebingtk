PastebinGTK is a Linux desktop client for the pastebin.com text sharing service (http://pastebin.com/). It is written in Python and uses GTK+ 3 for the GUI.

----

PastebinGTK requires the Python interpreter to run. Development is done using 2.7.x, but it should work with 3.x as well. GTK+ 3 is also required.

To run PastebinGTK, open a terminal in the directory containing the files and type "python pastebingtk.py".
